The Zen of Screaming is divided into two parts: the DVD and the CD. The DVD contains an introduction by Melissa Cross, where she explains the basics of vocal anatomy and physiology, and how screaming works. She also demonstrates some common mistakes that screamers make, such as pushing too hard, tensing up or using the wrong muscles. She then introduces the concept of "false cords", which are the tissues above the true vocal cords that can produce a distorted sound when vibrated. She shows how to activate the false cords and how to blend them with the true cords to create different types of screams.
 
The DVD also features interviews and performances by some of Melissa Cross's students, such as Randy Blythe from Lamb of God, Jesse Leach from Killswitch Engage and Keith Buckley from Every Time I Die. They share their experiences and tips on screaming, and show how they apply Melissa Cross's methods to their own styles. The DVD also includes a bonus section with more exercises and warm-ups for screamers.
 
The CD contains 12 tracks of vocal exercises that Melissa Cross guides the listener through. The exercises are designed to help screamers develop their breath support, resonance, pitch accuracy, stamina and control. The CD also includes a booklet with instructions and diagrams for each exercise.
 
The Zen of Screaming is a useful and informative resource for anyone who wants to learn how to scream safely and effectively. Melissa Cross is a knowledgeable and charismatic teacher who explains everything clearly and patiently. The DVD and CD complement each other well, and provide a comprehensive and practical guide to screaming. The Zen of Screaming is not only for metal and rock singers, but for anyone who wants to explore their vocal potential and express themselves with more power and emotion.

One of the main benefits of The Zen of Screaming is that it teaches screamers how to avoid vocal damage and fatigue. Many singers who scream without proper technique end up hurting their voices and losing their range and quality. Melissa Cross explains how to scream in a healthy and sustainable way, by using the right muscles and breathing correctly. She also emphasizes the importance of warming up before and cooling down after screaming, and gives advice on how to take care of the voice in general.

Another benefit of The Zen of Screaming is that it helps screamers develop their own unique style and expression. Melissa Cross does not teach a one-size-fits-all method of screaming, but rather encourages screamers to experiment and find their own voice. She shows how to use different parts of the mouth, throat and chest to create different sounds and effects, such as growls, shrieks, whispers and roars. She also teaches how to modulate the volume, pitch and tone of the screams, and how to switch between clean and distorted vocals smoothly.
 
The Zen of Screaming is not only a technical guide, but also a motivational and inspirational one. Melissa Cross shares her passion and enthusiasm for screaming, and inspires screamers to overcome their fears and doubts. She also challenges some of the stereotypes and misconceptions that surround screaming, such as that it is only for angry or aggressive people, or that it is not musical or artistic. She shows how screaming can be a form of self-expression, creativity and empowerment, and how it can convey a wide range of emotions and messages.
 
The Zen of Screaming is a must-have for anyone who wants to learn how to scream or improve their screaming skills. It is a comprehensive and accessible guide that covers everything from the basics to the advanced aspects of screaming. It is also a fun and entertaining DVD and CD set that features some of the best screamers in the industry. The Zen of Screaming is not just a product, but a philosophy and a lifestyle that Melissa Cross invites screamers to join.
