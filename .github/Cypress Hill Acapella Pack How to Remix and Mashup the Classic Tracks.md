But Cypress Hill is more than just a rap group. They are also a cultural phenomenon that has influenced music, fashion, art, and politics. Cypress Hill was formed in 1988 by brothers Sen Dog and Mellow Man Ace, along with B-Real and DJ Muggs. They were the first Latino American hip hop group to go platinum and multi-platinum[^1^], and they introduced elements of Latin music, psychedelic rock, and horrorcore into their sound. They also pioneered the use of Spanish in their rhymes, paving the way for other bilingual rappers.[^2^]
 
Cypress Hill has also been vocal advocates for cannabis legalization and social justice. They have performed at pro-marijuana rallies, supported medical marijuana patients, and spoken out against police brutality and racial discrimination. They have also collaborated with other artists across genres, such as Rage Against the Machine, Pearl Jam, Sonic Youth, and Damian Marley. Their influence can be seen in the work of Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Wiz Khalifa, and many others.[^2^]
 
With Back in Black, Cypress Hill proves that they are still relevant and innovative after more than three decades in the game. They have not lost their edge or their passion, and they continue to push boundaries and challenge expectations. They are not only a rap group, but a legacy that transcends time and trends.
  
To get a sense of Cypress Hill's impact and legacy, it is worth listening to their own words. Here are some quotes from Cypress Hill members and fans that capture their essence and vision:
 
- "I think you definitely got to put intelligent lyrics down. You just can't come up and rap to the beat, shuffling my feet, sound so sweet. Rhyming isn't about putting no riddles down. It's about reaching people in their mutha f\*ckin' brain." - Sen Dog[^2^]
- "We can write a song and have a certain interpretation. Once it's out in the public everybody is going to get their own thing about it. Like you said, some people might take it in a more offensive way. Some might take it in more defensive ways. It's not something we are trying to encourage but we realize it can happen." - Bobo[^2^]
- "When it comes out of Cypress there's just so many different things that come to the table. When we get together to make a record. There's Eric's (Bobo) influences, my influences, Mugg's musical influences. Everybody's got something to put in. To just say we could make one album as Cypress with one style of music...I think that would be pretty much impossible." - Sen Dog[^2^]
- "Cypress Hill is one of my favorite groups of all time. They have such a unique sound and style that nobody can imitate. They are the pioneers of weed rap and they always keep it real. They have inspired me as a rapper and as a person." - Dizzy Wright[^3^]
- "Cypress Hill is the reason I started smoking weed and listening to rap music. They opened my mind to a whole new world of possibilities and creativity. They are legends in the game and they deserve all the respect and recognition they get." - Anonymous fan[^4^]
- "Cypress Hill is more than just music. It's a lifestyle, a culture, a movement. They have influenced generations of artists and fans with their message and their sound. They are not afraid to speak their mind and stand up for what they believe in. They are the voice of the people." - Anonymous fan[^4^]
