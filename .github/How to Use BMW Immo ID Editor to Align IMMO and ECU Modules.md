## Step 6: Write the Virginized Dump File to the ECU
 
The last step is to write the virginized dump file back to the ECU. You need to use the same programmer device that you used to read the ECU in the first place. Connect it to your computer and follow its instructions to write the virginized dump file to the ECU.
 
## Step 7: Synchronize the ECU with the Key and CAS
 
After writing the virginized dump file to the ECU, you need to synchronize it with your key and CAS. You can do this with a diagnostic tool that supports BMW coding and programming, such as INPA, ISTA, Autel MaxiSys Pro, etc.
 
Connect your diagnostic tool to your car and follow its instructions to perform CAS synchronization or DME-CAS alignment. This will make your key and CAS recognize your new or repaired ECU and allow you to start your engine.
