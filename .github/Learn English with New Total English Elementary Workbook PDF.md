The listening section provides a variety of accents and situations to help students develop their listening skills. The speaking section offers opportunities for students to practice speaking in pairs or groups, using the language from the coursebook units.
 
The workbook also has a vocabulary section that helps students learn and review high-frequency words and phrases related to the topics of the coursebook units.
