The third step is to plug in your 4ch USB Dvr device to your computer using a USB cable. Make sure that your computer is turned on and that you have an available USB port. Once you plug in the device, your computer may automatically detect it and try to install a generic driver for it.

4. Select `Browse my computer for driver software`.
5. Select `Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer`.
6. Select `Have Disk`.
7. Browse to the driver folder that you extracted in step 2 and select the file named `EasycapDC60.inf`.
8. Click `Open`, then click `OK`.
9. Select `Easycap DC60 Video Capture Device`, then click `Next`.
10. If you see a warning message saying that the driver is not digitally signed, click `Install this driver software anyway`.
11. Wait for the installation to complete, then click `Close`.
