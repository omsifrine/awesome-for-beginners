# Vensim 6.0b Portable: A Powerful Tool for System Dynamics Modeling
 
Vensim is a software package that allows you to create, analyze, and simulate system dynamics models. System dynamics is a method of understanding the behavior of complex systems over time, such as business, social, environmental, or engineering systems. Vensim can help you to design better policies, strategies, and solutions for your problems.
 
Vensim 6.0b Portable is a version of Vensim that can run from a USB drive or a cloud storage service, without requiring installation or registration. This makes it convenient for users who want to use Vensim on different computers or share it with others. Vensim 6.0b Portable has all the features of Vensim Professional, except for optimization and sensitivity analysis.

Vensim 6.0b Portable has some new features and bug fixes compared to the previous version. According to the official release notes[^1^] [^2^], these include:
 
- Vensim can now import and export CSV files, which are widely used for data exchange.
- Vensim has improved performance when importing large datasets.
- Vensim has fixed an error that would appear if running SyntheSim with Minimal Memory enabled. SyntheSim is a feature that allows you to interactively change model inputs and see the effects on outputs.
- Vensim has fixed an error in the equations for exponential growth and decay when using SyntheSim override.
- Vensim has fixed an issue with passing command line arguments in a venapp (a standalone application created with Vensim).
- Vensim has fixed an issue with bitmaps on the Mac version.
- Vensim has fixed an issue with string variables not appearing as inputs in the equation editor.
- Vensim has fixed an issue with reading optimization output files as a changes file.

Vensim 6.0b Portable is not only a powerful tool for system dynamics modeling, but also a flexible and user-friendly one. You can create models using graphical diagrams, equations, or both. You can use a variety of functions, constants, and units to express your model logic. You can also use subscripts and arrays to handle multiple dimensions and scenarios. Vensim has a built-in syntax checker and error tracer to help you debug your models.
 
Vensim 6.0b Portable also allows you to visualize and communicate your model results. You can create graphs, tables, and dashboards to display your model outputs. You can customize the appearance and format of your charts and data. You can also export your model results to other formats, such as Excel, Word, PowerPoint, or PDF.
 
Vensim 6.0b Portable is compatible with Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux operating systems. It can run on any computer that has a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed. You can also use Vensim 6.0b Portable with other software tools, such as Stella, iThink, Powersim, or MATLAB.
 
If you are interested in system dynamics modeling and want to try Vensim 6.0b Portable, you can download it from the official website for free. You can also purchase a license for Vensim Professional or Vensim DSS (Decision Support System), which have more advanced features and capabilities.
