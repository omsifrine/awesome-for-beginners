If you are a fan of retro gaming, you might have heard of Neo Geo, a video game platform developed by SNK in the 1990s. Neo Geo was famous for its arcade-quality graphics and sound, as well as its large library of games that spanned various genres such as fighting, shooting, sports, and puzzle.

However, Neo Geo was also very expensive and rare, making it hard for many gamers to own or play it. Fortunately, thanks to emulation technology, you can now enjoy Neo Geo games on your computer or mobile device without spending a fortune. Emulation is a process of mimicking the hardware and software of one system on another system. By using an emulator program and a rom file, you can play any Neo Geo game on your device as if you were playing on the original console.
 
A rom file is a digital copy of the game data stored on a cartridge or disc. You can find many websites that offer neo geo roms full set 181 games free download. However, not all of them are safe or legal. Some of them may contain viruses, malware, or fake files that can harm your device or infringe on the copyrights of the game developers. Therefore, you should always be careful and selective when downloading neo geo roms from the internet.
