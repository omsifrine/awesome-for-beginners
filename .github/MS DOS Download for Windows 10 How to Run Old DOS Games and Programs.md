# How to Download and Run MS DOS on Windows 10
 
MS DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System) is a 16-bit operating system for x86-based personal computers. It was the most widely used operating system in the 1980s and early 1990s, before Windows took over. MS DOS is a simple and fast operating system that allows you to run programs and commands from a command-line interface.

If you want to download and run MS DOS on Windows 10, you have two options: using a DOS emulator or using the built-in Command Prompt. Here are the steps for both methods:
 
## Using a DOS Emulator
 
A DOS emulator is a software that simulates the environment and functionality of MS DOS on a modern computer. There are many DOS emulators available online, such as DOSBox, vDos, and FreeDOS. To use a DOS emulator, you need to download and install it on your Windows 10 computer, and then follow the instructions on how to run MS DOS programs and commands.
 
For example, if you want to use DOSBox, you can download it from [https://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1](https://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1) and install it on your computer. Then, you can launch DOSBox and type in the commands you want to execute. You can also mount a folder on your computer as a virtual drive in DOSBox, and access the files and programs stored in that folder. For more details on how to use DOSBox, you can refer to the official documentation at [https://www.dosbox.com/wiki/Main\_Page](https://www.dosbox.com/wiki/Main_Page).
 
## Using the Command Prompt
 
The Command Prompt is a native feature of Windows 10 that allows you to run commands and programs from a command-line interface. It is similar to MS DOS, but it has some differences and limitations. For example, some MS DOS commands may not work or have different syntax in the Command Prompt, and some MS DOS programs may not run or display correctly in the Command Prompt.
 
To use the Command Prompt, you need to enable it on your Windows 10 computer, and then launch it from the Start menu or by pressing Windows + R keys and typing cmd. Then, you can type in the commands you want to execute. You can also navigate to the folder where your MS DOS programs are stored, and run them by typing their file name with either a .EXE or .COM extension.
 
For example, if you want to run a MS DOS program called GAME.EXE that is stored in C:\DOS\GAMES folder, you can type in the following commands:

    cd C:\DOS\GAMES
    GAME.EXE

The first time you run a MS DOS program in the Command Prompt, a window will pop up, telling you that you need to configure some settings for compatibility. You can follow the instructions on how to adjust the settings for optimal performance and display. For more details on how to use the Command Prompt, you can refer to this article at [https://www.pcworld.com/article/415275/how-to-run-a-dos-program-in-windows-10.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/415275/how-to-run-a-dos-program-in-windows-10.html).
