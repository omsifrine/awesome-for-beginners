In this article, we will show you how to use FairUse Wizard 3D R2 Full Edition to convert your DVDs to DivX format in a few simple steps.

Once the installation is complete, launch the program from your desktop or start menu.
 
## Step 2: Insert your DVD disc and select it as the source
 
Insert the DVD disc that you want to convert into your DVD drive. The program will automatically detect it and display it as the source in the main window. You can also select a DVD folder or an ISO image file as the source by clicking on the "Browse" button next to the source field.
 
## Step 3: Choose your output format and settings
 
Click on the "Next" button at the bottom of the main window to proceed to the output settings screen.

The program will estimate the output quality based on your file size choice.
 
You can also select which audio track and subtitle track you want to include in your output file from the respective drop-down menus. If you want to encode multiple audio tracks or subtitles, you can check the "Multiple audio tracks" or "Multiple subtitles" boxes and select them from the list that appears. You can also change the language and font settings for your subtitles by clicking on the "Subtitle options" button.
 
If you want to customize your output settings further, you can click on the "Advanced options" button at the bottom of the screen.
